# About Clementine

*Clementine* is a webcomic collaboration between [T.J. Lockwood](https://www.tjlockwood.com) and Celesta De Roo. Set in a retro-futuristic world, Clementine explores life on an airborne military cargo vessel currently running missions over the Atlantic. The characters are quirky, the setting is constantly shifting, and life in the skies is memorable in a multitude of ways. Featuring full page spreads, Clementine is still early in the developmental process and will be produced in full colour.

Stay tuned for more updates as the project transitions from concept to page.
